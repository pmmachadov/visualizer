# My Folder Traverser Project

# My steps

## 1. Setup the Project Environment

### Task 1: Initialize the Project
Create a new directory for the project and initialize it with `npm` to manage dependencies:
```bash
mkdir my-folder-traverser
cd my-folder-traverser
npm init -y
Task 2: Install ESLint
Install ESLint to ensure the code follows best practices and style guidelines:


npm install eslint --save-dev
npx eslint --init

2. HTML and CSS Setup

Task 3: Create Basic HTML Structure
Create an index.html file. Add the necessary HTML to handle file input and display the folder contents.

Task 4: Styling with CSS

Create a styles.css file and style the folder display to be collapsible. This might involve basic CSS for visibility toggling.

3. JavaScript Development
Task 5: Create JavaScript File
Initialize a script.js file where the main functionality will reside.

Task 6: Implement File Selection
Use an <input> element of type directory which allows users to select a directory. Ensure cross-browser compatibility as much as possible or provide alternatives.

Task 7: Recursive Folder Traversal
Develop a function to recursively traverse the selected directory. Display each folder and file in a structured, collapsible format.

Task 8: Display Contents
For each file encountered, optionally read and display its content in a text format. Handle different file types appropriately to avoid errors with binary files.

4. Applying SOLID Principles
Task 9: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Ensure that each JavaScript function does one thing only, such as one function for reading the directory and another for displaying the contents.

Task 10: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Design the folder traversal and display functions to be open for extension but closed for modification.

Task 11: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Ensure that derived classes or functions that override their base can replace the base without affecting the functionality.

Task 12: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Avoid forcing the project to depend on interfaces it does not use.

Task 13: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

5. Testing and Refinement
Task 14: Write Basic Tests
Write some basic unit tests to ensure the functions handle expected and unexpected inputs gracefully.

Task 15: Debug and Refine
Test the project thoroughly to iron out bugs and enhance the user interface based on test feedback.

6. Documentation
Task 16: Document the Code
Ensure the code is well-documented, explaining how each part works and how to set up the project.
